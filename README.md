# BrandonBox 2.0

Welcome to BrandonBox 2.0, a Terraria mod that brings a plethora of new characters, quests, and adventures to your game!

## Introducing New NPCs:

![Gravedigger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gymnopediese/BrandonBox/main/NPCs/Gravedigger/Gravedigger_Head.png) **The Gravedigger**: An aficionado of both money and tombstones, this enterprising character spawns in graveyards when the Tax Collector is in town. With his unique approach to tax collection, he offers a cure for zombies, transforming them into villagers!

![Villager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gymnopediese/BrandonBox/main/NPCs/Villager/Villager_Head.png) **The Villager**: Once cured of their zombie state, these ordinary humans become invaluable members of your town. With no limits on how many can join, your cities will teem with life as never before! Just ensure they have a bed for a well-deserved rest.

![Daughter of the Sun](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gymnopediese/BrandonBox/main/NPCs/DaughterOfSun/DaughterOfSun_Head.png) **The Daughter of the Sun**: Held captive by harpies, the Daughter of the Sun needs your help to reclaim her freedom. However, don't expect her to settle for anything less than a cloud house – she's quite particular. Offer her some gold, and she'll even convince her father to rise earlier in the day!

![FisherMan](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gymnopediese/BrandonBox/main/NPCs/FisherMan/FisherMan_Head.png) **The FisherMan**: A master angler and friend of the Angler, this character moves into a home with its own pool after you've completed 75 angler quests. Just don't mention his fishing accident – it's a sensitive topic.

![Creeper](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gymnopediese/BrandonBox/main/NPCs/Creeper/Creeper_Head.png) **The Creeper**: Once a menace from distant lands, this reformed character now peddles explosives with a smile. Thanks to anger management therapy, he's traded detonations for deals, surpassing even the Miner in his explosive offerings.

![Death](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gymnopediese/BrandonBox/main/NPCs/Death/Death_Head.png) **The Death**: After countless attempts to claim your life, Death itself sets up shop in your town. For a mere copper, he can end your existence or offer potions for a romantic, Romeo and Juliet-style demise.

![Rain Man](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gymnopediese/BrandonBox/main/NPCs/RainMan/RainMan_Head.png) **The Rain Man**: A chill character who arrives when the rain falls, he sells an array of water-related items – including one that can control the weather itself!

![Ninja](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gymnopediese/BrandonBox/main/NPCs/Ronin/Ronin_Head.png) **Ninja**: A survivor of the Ninja Village's fall to the Slim King, this ninja pays homage to fallen comrades by selling items from his homeland.

![Poacher](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gymnopediese/BrandonBox/main/NPCs/Poacher/Poacher_Head.png) **Poacher**: Half-panda, half-suspicious seller, this character deals in rare caged animals. While his past might be questionable, his inventory is undeniably intriguing.

![TVGuy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gymnopediese/BrandonBox/main/NPCs/TVGuy/TVGuy_Head.png) **TVGuy**: Currently without a purpose, but surely his time will come!

Dive into BrandonBox 2.0 and discover a world of endless possibilities, where every NPC brings a unique story and opportunity for adventure!
