# BrandonBox 2.0

Welcome to BrandonBox 2.0, a Terraria mod that brings a plethora of new characters, quests, and adventures to your game!

## Introducing New NPCs:

![Gravedigger](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gymnopediese/BrandonBox/main/NPCs/Gravedigger/Gravedigger_Head.png)  **The Gravedigger** : This man loves only two things: money and searching for money in graves. He constantly roams graveyards, all to make as much money as possible. He sells zombie cures, apparently allowing zombies to be cured and returned to their villager state... He won't hesitate to curse the village to increase his profits...

### Spawn conditions

The Tax Collector must be present in your village (He is frustrated by the poor work of this man and will therefore collect taxes in his own way...(2 silver per in game hours))

### House conditions

His house must be in a cemetery.

![Villager](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gymnopediese/BrandonBox/main/NPCs/Villager/Villager_Head.png)  **The Villager** : Once a zombie has been cured, it becomes a poor defenseless villager and will need a roof. You can cure an INFINITE number of zombies and therefore have an INFINITE number of villagers in your town !!! They will pay tax to both the tax collector and the grave digger.

### Spawn conditions

Any zombie that has been applied the Zombie Cure item.

### House conditions

His house must have a bed, normal humans need sleep...

### Specificities

Since having infinite Villager added to the npc pannel would be a mess and most likely impossible, the villager exist only once in the npc pannel. By talking to any npc, the focus will be given to him and you'll be able to select him an house. For the moment they cannot join an house by there own, you will have to assign one to them. (I'm working on it)

![TVGuy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gymnopediese/BrandonBox/main/NPCs/TVGuy/TVGuy_Head.png)  **TVGuy** : This former TV presenter completely lost it one day while he was live in front of millions of people... Since then, he has been gradually sinking into paranoia, believing in every conspiracy theory that comes his way. He particularly believes in aliens and it's to investigate them that he will come to your town. He's developing his own camera system on his own, he's still working on it so don't expect him to sell you anything until he's found all the necessary ingredients. He needs cables for example and can't seem to find any.
